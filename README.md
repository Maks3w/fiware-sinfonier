## Introduction
Sinfonier is a technology that solves the problem of collection and real-time processing of large amounts of information. Integrates, processes and analyzes multiple internal and external data sources in a visual form and in real-time

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://www.fiware.org). Check also the [FIWARE Catalogue entry for Sinfonier](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/sinfonier)

You can find the User & Programmer's Manual and the Installation & Administration Manual on [readthedocs.org](https://fiware-sinfonier.readthedocs.org)

## GEi overall description
The solution implements a Big Data platform shaped through an open-source technology stack. The architecture allows the integration of sources in real time so that the information is collected, processed and stored for its subsequent analysis using batch processing approach.

Essentially, Sinfonier provides capabilities to retrieve information, sharing within the platform through a persistent data queue, to process the information gathered, to transform and enrich it using real-time technologies, to store this information in a database, and, finally, to make an exploitation of the processed information.

Sinfonier represents a change in focus in respect to current solutions in the area of real-time information processing. We combine an easy-to-use interface, which is modular and adaptable, and we integrate it with an advanced technological solution that allows customers to do the necessary tune up required for their needs in matters concerning information security
